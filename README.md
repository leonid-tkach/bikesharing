## The Purpose
### What is this analysis for?

I do this analysis to gauge opportunities for bike sharing business in Des Moines. I use NYC Citibike experience as a benchmark. I am most interested in how far is my hometown from NYC in terms of potential customers behavior

## Checkout Times for Users
### For how long NYC customers ride shared bikes?

It's obvious from the picture below that most of them are just fooling around: they ride for less than ten minutes. If my future customers are like that, I should locate stations close to one another to enable them to feel satisfied with their "trips". Or they'll have to leave bikes at stations they started from, which may be disappointing. Top starting and ending locations are not in disagreement with the last notion.

## Checkout Times by Gender
### Does grouping by gender provide me with any extra information?

When I aggregate checkout times by gender, the picture gets more complicated. It turns out that customers who prefer not to convey their gender ride much longer. Most of them use they bikes for 10 to 30 minutes. Possible they love riding so much that they don't want to waste their time on ticking forms*. I'll have to try to estimate how many of potential customers have similar approach to forms and how many of them in my town.

It's possible that NYC Citibike not attractive enough for female customers. It may be due to something with the bikes. I should look into different bike popularity by gender and opt for the right model for my company.

\* That is the best explanation. See "Trips by Weekday per Hour".

## Trips by Weekday per Hour
### At what hours on what weekdays do customers use bike most intensively?

I see that I should do all the maintenance from 10-12 AM on Monday-Wednesday, at least if my hometowners' habits are similar to those of New Yorkers. There are even "better" hours from 12-6 AM, but it would definitely make my employees unhappy and i don't want that.

## Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
### Do genders tell me anything new about bike use per weekday?

They do! Customers not specifying their gender use bikes mostly on weekends, which means they are probably just in a happy weekend hurry to enjoy their ride.

## Subscrivers' and nNon-Subscribers' Trips by Gender by Weekday
### Is there any difference between them besides subscription?

There is. Subscribers use bikes only on weekdays. I should build station near business centers for them. They definitely use bike to get to their job and back.
